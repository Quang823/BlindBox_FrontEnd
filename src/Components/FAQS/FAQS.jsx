    question: "What is a Blind Box?",
    answer:
      "A Blind Box is a collectible toy packaging where the specific item inside remains a surprise until opened. Each box features multiple possible figures, with some rare 'secret' or 'chase' editions that have a very low probability of appearing.",
  },
  {
    question: "If I buy two Blind Boxes, will I get duplicates?",
    answer:
      "In a single Blind Box collection, the probability of getting duplicates is very low. However, some brands may have specific packaging rules that allow for the possibility of duplicates.",
  },
  {
    question: "If I buy a full sealed set, will I get all unique figures?",
    answer:
      "A full sealed set usually guarantees all standard figures shown on the packaging. However, in some cases, one of the standard figures might be replaced by a rare 'secret' edition. Some brands may still include duplicates, depending on their packaging rules.",
  },
  {
    question: "What is the difference between a Figure and an Action Figure?",
    answer:
      "Figures are collectible toy models, often limited edition and sometimes handcrafted by the original artist, making them highly valuable. Action Figures, on the other hand, have articulated joints, allowing for movement and interchangeable parts. They are commonly produced in scales like 1:6, 1:8, or 1:12.",
  },
  {
    question: "How long does shipping take?",

  {
    question: "What if my item arrives damaged?",
